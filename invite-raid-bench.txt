@Classic EU Starting invites!

:small_red_triangle_down: __If you are in the first raid today__:
:small_orange_diamond: `/w Dokenbank inv` and wait for raid to start.


:small_red_triangle_down: __If you are **not** in the first raid today or are benched today__:
:small_orange_diamond: `/w Budzshekel inv`
:small_orange_diamond:  Once you have joined a raid __invited by this character__, you are accounted for and __can log out__ on that character. __Do not leave the raid though__.
:small_orange_diamond: If you are not immediately getting an invite, then I probably have to switch groups, just try again in a minute or so.
